# What is Conduktor Platform ?

We take the complexity out of Kafka. We give you a platform to build, explore, test, monitor, and collaborate with confidence. 
Simplifying the complexity of real-time data streaming, Conduktor Platform enables leading organizations to improve team productivity and unlock true business value.
